I am currently in my third year as a Computational Linguistics B.A. student at Heidelberg University, where I also work as an undergraduate research assistant in the <a href="https://www.gs.uni-heidelberg.de/en" target="_blank" title="Disclaimer">Department of German Language and Literature</a>, focusing on protagonist classification in moralization contexts.

My main research interests lie at the intersection of **Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Visual Computing**.

I am always on the lookout for exciting **internship** opportunities in these fields.
